# A Note on My Project & AI Tool Usage

## About Me

I'm 23 years old and have been coding since 2021—roughly 5 years of experience across Python, Java, Swift, React, and TypeScript. I previously completed Programming II at another institution but did not receive transfer credit due to a medical withdrawal during a health crisis.

I work professionally as a **Data Engineer at a neuroscience lab**, where I understand firsthand the importance of systems thinking, file organization, and thorough documentation. In this role, I also **mentor two computer science interns**, teaching them the same principles I've applied to this project.

My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/luvisaisa) documents the time and effort I invest in coding and developing my skills.

## On AI Tool Usage

I want to be transparent: **I use AI tools to assist my development work.** This is true for this project and for my professional work. I do not deny this, nor do I believe it should be hidden.

Specifically, AI assisted me with:
- JLine3 terminal configuration for proper ASCII art display on macOS
- Gradle distribution setup for the fat JAR packaging
- Debugging edge cases in the console UI rendering

However, AI did not:
- Design the architecture (Game → Dome → Galaxy → Star hierarchy)
- Come up with the Super Mario Galaxy domain model
- Write the 121 stars worth of game data
- Create the dual Mario/Luigi tracking system concept
- Debug the countless hours of trial and error

**Using AI effectively is itself a skill.** It requires:
- Systems thinking to know what to ask
- Detail orientation to verify and integrate responses
- Communication skills to prompt effectively
- Domain knowledge to evaluate whether suggestions are correct
- The ability to read, understand, and modify generated code

## On Professionalism

Submitting an announcement mid-presentation to inform the class that AI detection tools would be used was unprofessional and disruptive.

I also observed that:
- Class started late approximately 50% of the time
- TikTok audio was audible through your microphone during student presentations

I mention this not to deflect, but to note that professionalism is a two-way expectation.

## On the Future of Software Development

AI-assisted coding is not the future—it is the present. It is:
- Encouraged at my workplace
- Standard practice across the tech industry
- A tool that amplifies skill rather than replacing it

A student who cannot use AI tools effectively is less prepared for the workforce than one who can. Penalizing students for using industry-standard tools—while not providing clear guidelines beforehand—does a disservice to their professional development.

## Conclusion

This project represents significant effort, skill, and time. The architecture, documentation, and polish reflect my professional experience and personal standards—not the output of clicking "generate."

I am happy to discuss any aspect of my code, explain my design decisions, or walk through my implementation in detail.

**Coding is my livelihood. This project reflects that.**
